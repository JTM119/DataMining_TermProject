# DataMining_TermProject
Plant Disease Classification

The code used for most of the operations in this project is all in PlantDiseaseClassification.ipynb. There are two notebooks in the sandbox folder which contain notebooks used for experimentation. These contain code chunks that were used and experimented with. The PCA file contains the code to use PCA for dimensionality reduction to create an input for the random forest and svm models.
